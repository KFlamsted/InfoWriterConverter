# AI Development Notes

This document contains development notes and insights about the InfoWriter Converter project, created with AI assistance.

## Project Overview

This C# console application was developed to solve a specific problem: converting raw InfoWriter OBS plugin output into clean, readable timestamp-note pairs. The InfoWriter plugin allows content creators to take live notes during recording/streaming, but the raw output includes verbose event information that needs cleaning.

## Development Process

### Problem Analysis
The original request included example input/output files that clearly showed the transformation pattern needed:
- Input: Verbose OBS plugin logs with events, timestamps, and metadata
- Output: Clean timestamp + note pairs

### Algorithm Design
The core algorithm processes the input line by line:

1. **Line Classification**: Identify lines starting with "EVENT:" or "HOTKEY:"
2. **Timestamp Extraction**: Parse the following line for timestamp format `0:MM:SS`
3. **Event Handling**: Different logic for different event types:
   - HOTKEY events → Extract note name and create output line
   - PAUSE/RESUME events → Create special output lines
   - START/STOP events → Skip entirely
4. **Block Processing**: Handle the 3-line blocks (event + timestamp + empty line)

### Key Implementation Decisions

#### Regular Expressions
Used regex for robust parsing:
- `@"^(\d+:\d{2}:\d{2})"` - Extract timestamps
- `@"HOTKEY:([^@]+)@"` - Extract note keys from HOTKEY lines

#### Error Handling
Implemented comprehensive error handling:
- File not found exceptions
- Malformed timestamp warnings
- Missing note key warnings
- Graceful degradation for unexpected input

#### Code Structure
- Single-file console application for simplicity
- Static methods for easy testing
- Clear separation of parsing logic and file I/O

## Technical Challenges Addressed

### 1. Line Block Processing
The input format uses 3-line blocks that needed careful index management to avoid processing the same lines multiple times.

### 2. Event Type Discrimination
Different event types required different handling:
- Some events should be converted (HOTKEY, PAUSE/RESUME)
- Some should be filtered out (START/STOP)
- This required flexible string matching logic

### 3. Timestamp Format Consistency
The output needed consistent timestamp formatting matching the example, requiring precise regex patterns.

### 4. Command Line Interface
Added flexible CLI to support different use cases:
- Default behavior for quick testing
- Custom file paths for production use
- Clear usage instructions and error messages

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses `File.ReadAllLines()` which is suitable for reasonable file sizes
- **Processing Speed**: Linear O(n) time complexity for line processing
- **I/O Optimization**: Single read and single write operation

For very large files (thousands of events), the implementation could be optimized to:
- Use streaming file reading
- Process in chunks
- Implement parallel processing for multiple files

## Testing Strategy

The implementation was tested against the provided example files:
- `input-example.txt` (121 lines) → `output-example.txt` (40 lines)
- Validated correct handling of all event types
- Verified timestamp extraction accuracy
- Confirmed proper line filtering

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified during development:

1. **Configuration File**: Support for custom note type mappings
2. **Batch Processing**: Built-in support for processing multiple files
3. **Output Formats**: Support for different output formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
4. **GUI Interface**: Windows Forms or WPF interface for non-technical users
5. **Validation Mode**: Preview changes before writing output
6. **Statistics**: Report on number of events processed, filtered, etc.

## Code Quality Measures

- **Null Safety**: Uses nullable reference types (C# 8.0+)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling
- **Documentation**: XML comments for public methods
- **Logging**: Console output for warnings and status
- **Standards**: Follows C# naming conventions

## AI Collaboration Notes

This project demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration:

1. **Problem Definition**: Human provided clear examples and requirements
2. **Algorithm Critique**: AI analyzed the proposed approach and suggested improvements
3. **Implementation**: AI wrote robust, production-ready code
4. **Documentation**: AI created comprehensive README and development notes

The iterative feedback process ensured the solution addressed edge cases and followed best practices that might not have been immediately obvious from the initial requirements.
